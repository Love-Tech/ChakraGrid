# ChakraGrid
ChakraGrid is a plugin that addresses the current pitfalls with CSS-only grid scaffolding.  Notably, ChakraGrid aligns the heights of cells in each row thus eliminating the Bootstrap and Materialize grid "Gap Problem" with cells of differing heights.  There are also additional options that allow orphan cell(s) to fill the full width for a more flush look

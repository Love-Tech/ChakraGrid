# ChakraGrid
ChakraGrid is the next generation grid template, improving the CSS-only Bootstrap and Materialize.css approaches to responsive grids by addressing the current pitfalls with CSS-only grid scaffolding.  

   Notably, ChakraGrid aligns the heights of cells in each row thus eliminating the Bootstrap and Materialize grid "Gap Problem" with cells of differing heights
   Additionally, ChakraGrid uses the width of the parent element, not the entire screen width like Bootstrap and Materialize to determine which size class to use for the columns.
   ChakraGrid uses the width of the parent element rather than the width of the page
   There are also additional options that allow orphan cell(s) to fill the full width for a more flush look
